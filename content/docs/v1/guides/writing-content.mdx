# Writing Content

DocXes empowers developers to write high-quality documentation using Markdown and MDX.

## Frontmatter

Each MDX file **must** include frontmatter. This metadata is used for navigation, search, and SEO.

```yaml
---
title: My Page Title
description: A short description for the <meta> tag.
order: 5
keywords: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
---
```

### `title`
The primary heading of the page. Displayed in the sidebar and as the `h1` at the top of the content.

### `description`
A brief summary. Used in search results and social sharing cards.

### `order`
Controls the position of the page in the sidebar. Lower numbers appear first. If omitted, files are sorted alphabetically.

### `keywords`
An array of strings. Use this to add synonyms or related terms that aren't explicitly mentioned in the text to improve search discoverability.

## File Organization

### Basic Structure

```text
content/docs/v1/
  getting-started/
    installation.mdx  (order: 1)
    configuration.mdx (order: 2)
  api/
    endpoints.mdx     (order: 3)
```

### Collapsible Sections

Folders become collapsible sections in the sidebar. The folder name is used as the section title (capitalized and hyphen-separated).

### Index Pages (`main.mdx`)

If you want a folder to be clickable itself (instead of just expanding/collapsing), add a `main.mdx` file inside it.

```text
content/docs/v1/
  api/
    main.mdx        <- Defines metadata for the "API" section link
    endpoints.mdx
```

## Hiding Content

You can hide files or folders from the public documentation without deleting them from your codebase.

- **Hide File**: Rename `draft.mdx` to `draft.hidden.mdx`.
- **Hide Folder**: Rename `private-docs/` to `private-docs.hidden/`.

The build system automatically filters out any path segment containing `.hidden`. This is great for drafting new features or maintaining internal documentation alongside public docs.
