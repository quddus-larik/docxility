# Installation

Launch a high-performance documentation site in minutes. DocXes is designed to be cloned and customized as a template, giving you immediate access to all source code.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js**: v20.0.0 or higher
- **Package Manager**: pnpm (recommended), npm, or yarn
- **Git**: For version control

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**:
   Start by cloning the official starter template.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/quddus-larik/docxes.git my-docs
   cd my-docs
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   We recommend `pnpm` for fast, efficient dependency management.
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   Launch the local dev server with Turbopack.
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your site.

## Production Build

To build your site for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This will generate a static optimization of your documentation, ready for deployment to Vercel, Netlify, or any Node.js hosting.

## Next Steps

Once you have the site running, familiarize yourself with the [Project Structure](/docs/v1/getting-started/project-structure).
