# Project Structure

A typical DocXes project is organized for clarity and separation of concerns. Since you own the code, it's important to understand where everything lives.

```text
├── content/
│   └── docs/             # Your content lives here
│       └── v1/           # Version folder (required)
│           ├── intro.mdx
│           └── guides/   # Sub-sections
├── components/
│   ├── ui/               # Reusable UI primitives (Buttons, Inputs)
│   ├── mdx/              # MDX components (Alerts, CodeBlocks)
│   └── ...               # Core layout components
├── lib/
│   ├── docs.ts           # Documentation engine & navigation logic
│   ├── search-index.ts   # Search indexing logic
│   └── configuration.tsx # Config merger
├── marketplace/          # Pre-built Theme Formulas (Shadcn, Curved)
├── hooks/                # State management hooks
├── public/               # Static assets (images, fonts)
├── app/                  # Next.js App Router (pages & layouts)
├── x-meta.config.tsx     # ⚙️ Main Configuration File
└── package.json
```

## Key Directories

### `content/docs/`
This is the most important folder for content creators. The structure here directly mirrors your site's sidebar navigation and URL routes.

### `x-meta.config.tsx`
The central control panel. Here you define:
- Site Metadata (Title, Description, URL)
- Active Theme (Marketplace formula)
- UI Overrides (Slots for Header, Sidebar, etc.)
- Search Provider Configuration

### `marketplace/`
Contains the "Theme Formulas". These are TypeScript objects that define the look and feel of your site. You can edit these files directly to create your own custom design system.

### `lib/` & `hooks/`
These folders contain the "engine" of DocXes. While you can modify them, they are pre-configured to handle:
- **`lib/docs.ts`**: Reading files, parsing frontmatter, and building the navigation tree.
- **`hooks/useSidebar.ts`**: Managing the sidebar's open/close state and expansion logic.
