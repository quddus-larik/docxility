# Getting Started with DocX

DocX is a production-ready, file-system driven documentation framework built on Next.js 16. It offers a "Formula-like" customization experience, allowing you to completely tailor the look and feel without fighting the framework.

## Installation

Since DocX is a Next.js template, you typically start by cloning the repository or using a starter.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/docxes.git my-docs
cd my-docs
pnpm install
```

## Project Structure

- **`content/docs`**: This is where your markdown/MDX files live.
- **`x-meta.config.ts`**: The central configuration file for your site metadata, theme, and UI components.
- **`components/`**: React components used in the application.

## Configuration

The heart of DocX is `x-meta.config.ts`. Here you can define your site's identity, enable features, and inject custom components.

```typescript
// x-meta.config.ts
export const XMeta = {
  siteName: "My Docs",
  description: "Best docs ever",
  siteUrl: "https://mydocs.com",
  documentsPath: "content/docs",
  theme: {
    mdx: {
      highlighter: "pretty-code",
      theme: "github-light",
    },
    // Headless Tailwind Customization
    cssVars: {
      root: { "radius": "0.5rem" },
      light: { "primary": "oklch(0.488 0.243 264.376)" },
      dark: { "primary": "oklch(0.985 0 0)" }
    }
  },
  // Plug your own components
  interface: {
    components: {
      sidebarHeader: MyLogoComponent,
      sidebarFooter: MyCopyrightComponent,
      // ...
    }
  }
};
```

## Creating Documentation

Documentation is versioned and file-system based.

1.  Navigate to `content/docs/v1`.
2.  Create a new file, e.g., `my-feature.mdx`.
3.  Add frontmatter:

```mdx
---
title: My Feature
description: Explaining how my feature works.
order: 1
---

# My Feature

Write your content here using **Markdown** or React components.
```

### Folder Structure

Folders created in `content/docs/v1` automatically become sections in the sidebar. To define metadata for a folder (like its title or order), add a `main.mdx` inside that folder.

## Customization

### Theming

DocX uses a "headless" Tailwind approach. You don't need to edit CSS files to change the primary color or border radius. Just update `theme.cssVars` in the config.

### Search

By default, DocX uses a local Fuse.js search provider. You can switch to other providers (like Algolia) by implementing the `SearchProviderInterface` and updating the config.

### Component Slots

You can inject custom content into key areas of the layout:

- **Sidebar Header/Footer**: Add logos, version switchers, or status indicators.
- **TOC Header/Footer**: Add "Edit this page" links or ad placements.

```typescript
// x-meta.config.ts
sidebarHeader: ({ version }) => <div>Version: {version}</div>
```
