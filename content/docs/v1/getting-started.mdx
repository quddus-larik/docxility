# Getting Started

Launch a high-performance documentation site in minutes. DocXes is designed to be cloned and customized as a template, giving you immediate access to all source code.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v20.0.0 or higher
- **Package Manager**: pnpm (recommended), npm, or yarn

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/quddus-larik/docxes.git my-docs
   cd my-docs
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your site.

## Project Structure

A typical DocXes project is organized for clarity and separation of concerns:

- **`content/docs/`**: Your Markdown/MDX files. Organized by version (e.g., `v1/`).
- **`x-meta.config.tsx`**: The main configuration file for site metadata and theme selection.
- **`marketplace/`**: Pre-built UI formulas (Shadcn, Curved, Minimal).
- **`components/`**: UI components and MDX logic.
- **`lib/`**: Core framework logic (file parsing, search indexing).

## Initial Configuration

Open `x-meta.config.tsx` to set your site's identity.

```tsx title="x-meta.config.tsx"
import { ShadcnUI } from "@/marketplace/shadcn-ui";
import { createConfig } from "@/lib/configuration";

export const XMeta = createConfig({
  ...ShadcnUI, // Select your theme
  siteName: "My Documentation",
  siteUrl: "https://docs.example.com",
  searchProvider: "flexsearch",
});
```

## Adding Content

Documentation is file-system based. To add a new page:

1. Create a file at `content/docs/v1/my-new-page.mdx`.
2. Add the required frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: My New Page
description: A helpful description for SEO.
order: 1
---

# Welcome
This is your new page.
```

The sidebar will automatically update to include your new file based on the directory structure.
