# Development

This guide covers the technical details of creating content and extending the framework.

## Content Organization

Documentation is stored in `content/docs/` and organized by version folders.

```text
content/docs/
  v1/               # Version folder
    introduction.mdx
    advanced/       # Section folder
      setup.mdx
```

### Frontmatter Reference

Every MDX file must start with YAML frontmatter.

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `title` | `string` | The display title of the page. |
| `description` | `string` | Used for SEO and page headers. |
| `order` | `number` | Controls the position in the sidebar. |
| `keywords` | `string[]` | Keywords used by the search engine. |

## Navigation Hierarchy

DocXes automatically generates the sidebar based on your file structure:
- **Folders**: Become expandable sections.
- **Files**: Become navigation links.
- **`main.mdx`**: If a folder contains `main.mdx`, the folder name itself becomes a clickable link to that content.

## Hiding Content

You can hide files or entire folders from the public documentation while keeping them in your repository.

- **Files**: Rename `page.mdx` to `page.hidden.mdx`.
- **Folders**: Rename `folder` to `folder.hidden`.

The framework's indexing engine will automatically skip any path containing `.hidden`.

## Development Guardrails

To ensure easy upgrades, we recommend staying within these boundaries:

### ✅ Safe to Modify
- `x-meta.config.tsx`: All configuration lives here.
- `content/docs/`: Your documentation content.
- `marketplace/`: Your custom UI formulas.
- `public/`: Assets, logos, and icons.

### ⚠️ Internal Framework (Avoid Modifying)
- `app/`: Next.js routing and layout logic.
- `lib/`: Core logic for file parsing and search.
- `hooks/`: Framework state management.
- `components/ui/`: Standard UI primitives.

## Search Optimization

Our search engine (`flexsearch` or `local`) indexes titles, descriptions, and keywords. For the best search results:
1. Provide a concise `title`.
2. Use the `description` to summarize the page content.
3. Use `keywords` for synonyms or related terms not mentioned in the text.
