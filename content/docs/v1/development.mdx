# Development Guide

DocXes is designed to make documentation development seamless and intuitive. It uses a file-based routing system and supports MDX for rich content.

## Directory Structure

All documentation files are located in the `content/docs` directory, organized by version.

```text
content/docs/
  v1/
    introduction.mdx
    getting-started.mdx
    advanced/
      deep-dive.mdx
```

## Creating Pages

To create a new page, simply add an `.mdx` or `.md` file in the appropriate version directory. The URL will automatically match the file path.

### Frontmatter

Each page should include frontmatter at the top:

```markdown
---
title: My New Page
description: A brief description of what this page covers.
order: 5
---
```

- **title**: The display title of the page.
- **description**: Used for SEO and page headers.
- **order**: Controls the position in the sidebar navigation.

## Navigation & Hierarchy

DocXes automatically generates the sidebar based on your file structure.
- **Files**: Become individual links.
- **Folders**: Become expandable sections.
- **main.mdx**: If a folder contains a `main.mdx`, the folder name itself becomes a clickable link.

## Customization Guardrails

DocXes is designed to be a "low-touch" framework. For the best experience and easiest upgrades, follow these guidelines:

### ✅ Safe to Edit
These are the files you *should* modify to customize your documentation site:
- `x-meta.config.tsx`: Your primary control center. Change themes, site info, and UI overrides here.
- `content/docs/`: All your MDX/Markdown content goes here.
- `marketplace/`: Create or modify themes here.
- `public/`: Add your assets, logos, and favicons.

### ⚠️ Warning: Core Files
Avoid editing these unless you are confident in extending the framework:
- `app/`: Contains the routing and layout logic.
- `lib/`: Core utilities for document parsing and API responses.
- `hooks/`: Framework state management (sidebar, TOC, search).
- `components/ui/`: Standard UI primitives.
