DocXes uses a strictly typed, file-system based routing engine. This means your directory structure directly maps to your website's URL structure.

## File System Routing

Files placed in `content/docs/[version]/` are automatically turned into routes.

<MdxTable 
  headers={["File Path", "Generated URL"]}
  rows={[
    ["`content/docs/v1/intro.mdx` color", "`/docs/v1/intro`"],
    ["`content/docs/v1/api/auth.mdx`", "`/docs/v1/api/auth`"],
    ["`content/docs/v1/guides/setup/install.mdx`", "`/docs/v1/guides/setup/install`"]
  ]}
/>

### Index Pages (`main.mdx`)

If you want a folder to have its own page (instead of just being a collapsible section), create a `main.mdx` file inside it.

- `content/docs/v1/api/main.mdx` -> The folder "api" becomes a clickable link in the sidebar, pointing to `/docs/v1/api`.

### Arranging Files & Folder on Sidebar

- **Arrange Files**: You can just add `order: <number>` in header of file that show in sidebar with respect to order. If one file has `order:1` it show first on sidebar or in folder if file inside folder.
- **Arrange Folder**: You can just add main.mdx with only header `title, order` that can arrange the parant folder

## Versioning Strategies

DocXes supports multi-version documentation out of the box.

### Creating a New Version

1.  **Duplicate the Folder**: Copy `content/docs/v1` to `content/docs/v2`.
2.  **Update Config**: Open `x-meta.config.tsx` and update any version-specific logic if necessary (though the default engine detects folders automatically).

The system scans the `content/docs` root for directories and treats each top-level folder as a distinct version.

### Default Version

You can define which version should be loaded when a user visits `/docs`.

```tsx title="x-meta.config.tsx"
versions: {
  default: "v2", // Redirects /docs -> /docs/v2
}
```

## Hiding Content

You can hide files or folders from the sidebar and search index without deleting them. This is useful for drafting content.

- **Hide File**: Rename `feature.mdx` to `feature.hidden.mdx`.
- **Hide Folder**: Rename `advanced/` to `advanced.hidden/`.

The engine filters out any path segment containing `.hidden`.
