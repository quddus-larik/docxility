# Theming Engine

DocXes uses a unique "Headless Tailwind" approach. This allows you to completely radically change the visual design of your site without writing a single line of CSS or modifying component code.

## How It Works

1.  **Configuration**: You define colors and geometry in `x-meta.config.tsx`.
2.  **Injection**: The `ThemeInjector` component converts these TS objects into CSS variables.
3.  **Consumption**: Tailwind classes (like `bg-primary`, `rounded-lg`) are mapped to these variables.

## Anatomy of `cssVars`

The configuration object is split into three scopes:

```tsx
theme: {
  cssVars: {
    // 1. Root Scope (Global Geometry)
    root: {
      "radius": "0.5rem", // Controls rounded-*, rounded-md, etc.
    },
    
    // 2. Light Mode Colors
    light: {
      "primary": "oklch(0.2 0.1 260)",
      "primary-foreground": "oklch(0.98 0 0)",
      // ...
    },
    
    // 3. Dark Mode Colors
    dark: {
      "primary": "oklch(0.9 0.05 260)",
      "primary-foreground": "oklch(0.2 0.1 260)",
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

### Why OKLCH?

We recommend using **OKLCH** colors. Unlike RGB or HSL, OKLCH is perceptually uniform. This means if you change the hue, the perceived brightness stays the same, making it much easier to generate accessible color palettes programmatically.

## Component Tokens

Every standard UI component in DocXes is built using these semantic tokens.

- `bg-background`: The page background.
- `bg-card`: Card backgrounds.
- `bg-popover`: Dropdowns and dialogs.
- `bg-primary`: The main brand color (buttons, active states).
- `bg-secondary`: Subtle backgrounds (badges, secondary buttons).
- `bg-muted`: De-emphasized backgrounds (code blocks, disabled inputs).
- `bg-accent`: Interactive hover states.
- `bg-destructive`: Error states.

By mapping these tokens correctly in your config, you ensure that **every** component—from buttons to search dialogs—updates instantly to match your brand.
