# Theming DocXes

DocXes provides a powerful and flexible theming system that allows you to control everything from colors to component styles.

## CSS Variables

The easiest way to theme DocXes is by overriding CSS variables in `x-meta.config.tsx`. We support both light and dark modes.

```tsx
theme: {
  cssVars: {
    light: {
      "primary": "oklch(0.6 0.25 260)",
      "radius": "1rem",
    },
    dark: {
      "primary": "oklch(0.7 0.2 260)",
    }
  }
}
```

## Marketplace Themes

DocXes comes with a "Marketplace" of pre-built UI formulas. You can import these and apply them to your configuration instantly.

### Using Curved UI

To use the `CurvedUI` theme, import it and spread it into your config factory:

```tsx
import { CurvedUI } from "./marketplace/curved-ui";

export const XMeta = xMetaConfig({
  ...CurvedUI,
  siteName: "My Fancy Docs",
});
```

## Component Styles

You can also provide custom Tailwind classes to specific parts of the UI components (Sidebar, TOC, Pagination) via the `styles` property in the config.

```tsx
sidebar: {
  styles: {
    sidebar: "bg-slate-50 border-r-2",
    itemActive: "bg-blue-100 text-blue-700 font-bold",
  }
}
```

This "headless" approach allows you to customize the layout without rewriting the core logic.
