**DocXes** is a next-level documentation framework built for developers who demand full control without the overhead of proprietary core packages. It leverages the cutting-edge performance of **Next.js 16 (Turbopack)** and **React 19** to deliver a seamless, file-system driven documentation experience.

<MdxAlert title="The Zero-Core Philosophy" type="info">
  DocXes is not a black box. There are no compiled "core" npm packages hiding the logic. You own the code, you control the framework, and you customize every pixel.
</MdxAlert>

## Key Features

- **🚀 File-System Routing**: Your folder structure defines your documentation hierarchy. No JSON manifests or database required.
- **🎨 Headless UI**: Fully decoupled design system. Swap between pre-built themes or build your own using our "Marketplace" formula.
- **🔍 Advanced Search**: Built-in full-text search powered by FlexSearch with sub-millisecond latency.
- **⚡ Performance First**: Zero-runtime CSS-in-JS. We use atomic Tailwind v4 styles and native CSS variables for instant updates.
- **🧩 Slot-Based Architecture**: Inject custom components into headers, footers, and sidebars using simple arrow functions.
- **📦 MDX-Rich Content**: First-class support for MDX with a library of high-quality components like alerts, steps, and interactive code blocks.

## Why DocXes?

Most documentation tools force you into a specific workflow or design. DocXes provides the **infrastructure**—fetching, routing, searching, and state management—while leaving the **interface** and **logic** entirely in your hands.

Whether you're building a simple guide or a complex multi-versioned technical manual, DocXes scales with your needs without adding bloat.
