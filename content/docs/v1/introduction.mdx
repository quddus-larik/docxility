# Introduction - Version 2

Welcome to Version 2 of the documentation! This is a production-ready, file-system driven documentation system built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## What's New in V2

- Enhanced component library
- Improved search performance
- Better dark mode support
- Extended MDX capabilities

## Getting Started

The sidebar on the left will help you navigate through the documentation. Each page is automatically generated from markdown files in the `content/docs` directory.

You can create new pages by adding `.md` or `.mdx` files to the appropriate folders.
